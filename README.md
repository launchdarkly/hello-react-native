### LaunchDarkly Sample React Native Application  ###
We've built a simple application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works.  Below, you'll find the basic build procedure, but for more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart#/).
##### Build instructions  #####
1. Open the ```hello-react-native``` directory
2. Copy the mobile key from your account settings page from your LaunchDarkly dashboard into `App.js`.
3. Run `npm install start` in `hello-react-native`. This should download and create the directories for the project.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the server to deliver the bundle url. Make sure this is running before you start your application. 

##### iOS specific build instructions #####
4. Run your application through the Simulator or on a real device.
