 Collects the elements of a feature flag that changed as a result of a `clientstream` update or feature flag request. The SDK will pass a LDChangedFlag or a collection of LDChangedFlags into feature flag observer closures. The client app will have to convert the old/newValue into the expected type. See `LDClient.observe(key:owner:handler:)`, `LDClient.observe(keys:owner:handler:)`, and `LDClient.observeAll(owner:handler:)` for more details.
