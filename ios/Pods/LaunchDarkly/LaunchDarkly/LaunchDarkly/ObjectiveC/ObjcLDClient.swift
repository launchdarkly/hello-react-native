/**
 The LDClient is the heart of the SDK, providing client apps running iOS, watchOS, macOS, or tvOS access to LaunchDarkly services. This singleton provides the ability to set a configuration (LDConfig) that controls how the LDClient talks to LaunchDarkly servers, and a user (LDUser) that provides finer control on the feature flag values delivered to LDClient. Once the LDClient has started, it connects to LaunchDarkly's servers to get the feature flag values you set in the Dashboard.

 ### Objc Classes
 The SDK creates an Objective-C native style API by wrapping Swift specific classes, properties, and methods into Objective-C wrapper classes prefixed by `Objc`. By defining Objective-C specific names, client apps written in Objective-C can use a native coding style, including using familiar LaunchDarkly SDK names like `LDClient`, `LDConfig`, and `LDUser`. Objective-C developers should refer to the Objc documentation by following the Objc specific links following type, property, and method names.
 ## Usage
 ### Startup
 1. To customize, configure a LDConfig (`ObjcLDConfig`) and LDUser (`ObjcLDUser`). The `config` is required, the `user` is optional. Both give you additional control over the feature flags delivered to the LDClient. See `ObjcLDConfig` & `ObjcLDUser` for more details.
 - The mobileKey set into the `LDConfig` comes from your LaunchDarkly Account settings (on the left, at the bottom). If you have multiple projects be sure to choose the correct Mobile key.
 2. Call `[ObjcLDClient startWithConfig: user: completion:]` (`ObjcLDClient.startWithConfig(_:config:user:completion:)`)
 - If you do not pass in a LDUser, LDCLient will create a default for you.
 - The optional completion closure allows the LDClient to notify your app when it has gone online.
 3. Because the LDClient is a singleton, you do not have to keep a reference to it in your code.

 ### Getting Feature Flags
 Once the LDClient has started, it makes your feature flags available using the `variation` and `variationDetail` methods. A `variation` is a specific flag value. For example, a boolean feature flag has 2 variations, `YES` and `NO`. You can create feature flags with more than 2 variations using other feature flag types. See `LDFlagValue` for the available types.
 ````
 BOOL boolFlag = [ldClientInstance boolVariationForKey:@"my-bool-flag" defaultValue:NO];
 ````
 If you need to know more information about why a given value is returned, the typed `variationDetail` methods return an `LD<T>EvaluationDetail` with an detail about the evaluation.
 ````
 LDBoolEvaluationDetail *boolVariationDetail = [ldClientInstance boolVariationDetail:@"my-bool-flag" defaultValue:NO];
 BOOL boolFlagValue = boolVariationDetail.value;
 NSInteger boolFlagVariation = boolVariationDetail.variationIndex
 NSDictionary boolFlagReason = boolVariationValue.reason;
 ````

 See the typed `-[LDCLient variationForKey: defaultValue:]` or `-[LDClient variationDetailForKey: defaultValue:]` methods in the section **Feature Flag values** for details.

 ### Observing Feature Flags
 If you want to know when a feature flag value changes, you can check the flag's value. You can also use one of several `observe` methods to have the LDClient notify you when a change occurs. There are several options-- you can setup notifications based on when a specific flag changes, when any flag in a collection changes, or when a flag doesn't change.
 ````
 __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
 [ldClientInstance observeBool:@"my-bool-flag" owner:self handler:^(LDBoolChangedFlag *changedFlag) {
    __strong typeof(weakSelf) strongSelf = weakSelf;
    [strongSelf updateFlagWithKey:@"my-bool-flag" changedFlag:changedFlag];
 }];
 ````
 The `changedFlag` passed in to the block contains the old and new value. See the typed `LDChangedFlag` classes in the **Obj-C Changed Flags**.
